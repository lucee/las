Association Guidelines and Standing Orders

_Note; the aim is to agree, as Members, on a management process that works for us.  Then refer back to the LAS Articles of incorporation to see if there is any need for amendments or bylaws._

_Note; any amendments to the Articles generally requires a vote of the full membership.  This is not something that can be done by the management committee.  Although admittedly given the size of membership at the moment this should be a relatively straight forward process if needed._
