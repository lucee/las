Association Guidelines and Standing Orders

_Note; the aim is to agree, as Members, on a management process that works for us.  Then refer to the LAS Articles of incorporation to see if there is any need for amendments or bylaws. Amendments to the Articles require a vote of Members at a General Assembly._
