# LAS Management

There are a number of important roles to be filled within Lucee Association Switzerland (LAS). These roles are done on a voluntary basis by committed people who ensure the livelihood of the Lucee Server community at all levels.

_Note; the aim is to agree, as Members, on a management process that works for us.  Then refer back to the LAS Articles of incorporation to see if there is any need for amendments or bylaws._

_Note; any amendments to the Articles generally requires a vote of the full membership.  This is not something that can be done by the management committee.  Although admittedly given the size of membership at the moment this should be a relatively straight forward process if needed._

## LAS Management Committee

An executive body responsible for the day to day operations of LAS, and working towards the stated goals of LAS.  The committee is made up of elected officials from the Members.

_Note; currently it is assumed that the Management Committee is comprised of a single representative from each Member (either a corporate entity or individual). _

_Note; this is not sustainable in the longer term. ie. it doesn’t make sense to have all Members in all management meetings, all the time._

_Note; it is assumed that each Member representative has a single vote. To date this has not been correctly enforced; for example, no establishment of a quorum at meetings, and all company Members having multiple representatives voting at meetings._

## LAS Roles & Responsibilities 

The most important operational roles within LAS fall to the leadership of the elected Management Committee.

- Chairman
