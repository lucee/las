# Vice Chairman

The Vice-Chairman assists the Chairman in whatever capacity the Chairman needs.  In an operational sense, the Vice Chairman is responsible for acting as the Chairman in the Chairman’s absence.

_GB: How do we want to manage this?_

_The Vice Chairman role varies from place to place.  Sometimes it’s a not even a specific role in its own right; for example, the Secretary might fulfil this role for a short absence or the Management Committee might elect an “acting Chairman” in the event of a more extended absence._
